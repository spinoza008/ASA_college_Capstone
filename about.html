        <h6>Posted by Spinoza Delva</h6>
        <p>
          This project was made with HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT i added a tittle
          and a menu bar then 3 pictures fixed them with css, a background
          picture, underline each links under the pictures which can send you to
          each photos. <br />
          I added a read more link to websites that has more information about
          each of these meals. <br />
          In the header <strong>OUR FOOD</strong> which can send you to another
          page with mouse over.<br />
          In the next page i added JAVASCRIPT css that can make the image slide
          including information about the page and back a back to home button
          that can spend you back to the main page with mouse hover. <br />
          I also included a background picture and also buttons that can give an
          alert when purchase. <br />
          There are <strong>So Much Features added</strong> and also respected
          the guidelines the teacher asked i just wanted to make my looks nicer
          <br />
          <br />
           Thank you
